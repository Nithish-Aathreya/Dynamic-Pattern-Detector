1). 
(a). Finite and infinite state machine
     (1). Infinite SM: Number of states are not countable.
                       Example: model the states of galaxies in universe

     finite SM: Number of states are countable.
                       Example: model the states of vending machine digital
                       circuit. 

`   (2). State machines are sequential circuit, so to store the previous
     state flip flops are essential.In finite state machine as number of
     states are countable exact requirement number of filp flops can be
     determined, but in the case of infinite state machine cannot determine
     the number of flip flops or hardware required to build circuit, hence
     only finite state machines are fabricated.

     (3). In the case of infinite state machine cannot determine
     the number of flip flops or hardware required to build circuit, hence
     only finite state machines are fabricated.

(b). 2 types in finite state machine: i). Implicit state machine ii). Explicit state machine
                                                                      -Moore  - Mealy

    (ii).Moore:Transition between states only depends on current state.   
        Mealy:Transition between states depends on current state and present input.  

(c).Implicit state machine: States are not labelled by exclusive
    name,transition between states rely upon the way procedural blocks are coded.
   
   Explicit state machine: States are labelled by exclusive
    name,transition between states rely upon the logic implemented using
    if-else or case statements blocks.                                                                    

(e). -Infinte machine
     - Finite machine
            -implicit
            -explicit
                    -mealy
                    -moore

(f). In DFF states are not labelled exclusively by a name, instead the 2
    states in DFF are automatically understood by the way of procedural blocks and
    statements are coded, hence it is an example for implicit state machine.

2). 
(a). state machine is a diagram which reprsents relation of state transitions
     between them based on current input and stae.

(b). 
     Infinite SM: Number of states are not countable.
     finite SM: Number of states are countable.

(c). Only finite state machine

(d). 
    Moore:Transition between states only depends on current state.   
    Mealy:Transition between states depends on current state and present input.  

(e).
     In the case of infinite state machine cannot determine
     the number of flip flops or hardware required to build circuit, hence
     infinite state machines cannot be implemented in hardware.

(f). > Understand the design in terms of states
     > If states are finite, then it can be implemented in hardware.

(g). Since pattern detector has finite states it can be impelemented in
    hardware.

(h). For pattern detector testing we generate stimulus from testbench.
